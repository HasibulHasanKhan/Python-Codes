# What Is a Metaclass?
# In Python:

# Everything is an object.
# Every object is an instance of a class.
# But — classes themselves are also objects.

# So who creates classes?
# → Metaclasses create classes.

# In short:
# A metaclass is the “class of a class.”

## Relationship Chain : 

# ---Object → Class → Metaclass---
